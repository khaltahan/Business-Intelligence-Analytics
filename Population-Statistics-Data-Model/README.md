# **Population Statistics Data Model**

In this project, learners will be provided data about changes in population, employment, and income from
various government sources including; the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US Census Bureau, and the US
Federal Reserve. The data they are provided is saved in different locations, is raw and unclean, and requires
organization. The learner will perform an analysis of the data, but in order to do so will first need to utilize
the data preparation and modeling skills they learned in the course to build an efficient data model. This
data model will be the foundation upon which their analysis is built. They will need to connect to and
ingest various data sources, clean and organize that data, and build table relationships in an efficient table
schema. This will all be done using the Power BI tools covered in the course.

## Lessons:

**1. Relational Data & Table Structure:**

This lesson focuses on the fundamentals of relational database design, emphasizing the importance of identifying unique keys that enable the creation of relationships among different tables. Students will learn to recognize and categorize fact and dimension tables, essential for organizing data within a database. The session culminates with designing star schemas, which is crucial for structuring data in a way that simplifies querying and enhances performance in data retrieval tasks.

 **2. Power Query & M Overview**

In this lesson, students will explore the extensive functionalities of Power Query, a tool integral to data processing and manipulation in Excel and Power BI. The course will guide participants through the various features and tools available within Power Query, helping them to select the most appropriate tools for specific data cleaning scenarios. Additionally, learners will delve into the advanced editor to read and interpret M scripts, acquiring the skills to make basic modifications to these scripts to better suit their data handling needs.

**3. Data Cleaning & Organization**

The third lesson is dedicated to mastering data cleaning and organization using Power Query. Participants will employ various tools within Power Query to effectively clean and organize their data, ensuring high-quality and well-structured outputs. The lesson also introduces the creation of custom M formulas, a skill that enhances the flexibility and power of data cleaning processes, enabling participants to tailor their workflows to specific data challenges.

**4. DAX Language & Quantitative Analysis**

The final lesson introduces students to the Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) language used in Power BI for creating advanced calculations and data models. Learners will practice reading DAX code and making simple amendments to enhance existing formulas. The session covers the basics of using DAX to develop quantitative measurements and the correct setup of table relationships in Power BI. Moreover, it includes creating unique keys when necessary, facilitating smoother data management and analysis within Power BI environments.

# **Population Statistics Data Model**

In this project, learners will be analysts for a consulting company called Out-of-the-Box Analytics Inc.
They will review the clientâ€™s online job advertising data and, from the data driven insights they gather,
propose more efficient ways of allocating advertising funds. They will present their findings on a Power BI
dashboard. They will complete this project by utilizing the steps from the data analytics lifecycle, ensuring
the data has proper integrity, and applying the appropriate analytics method to deliver insights. Finally,
learners will create their own Power BI dashboard to communicate their findings.

## Lessons:

**1. Data Analytics Lifecycle:**

The data analytics lifecycle involves several steps: identifying the business problem, acquiring data, preparing and cleaning the data, analyzing the data, interpreting the results, and making decisions based on these insights. To determine where a project is within this lifecycle, assess the current activities against these stages. Moving forward in the lifecycle requires ensuring that each phase's criteria are met, such as data cleanliness and relevance before proceeding from preparation to analysis. This ensures the integrity and effectiveness of the analytics outcomes.

**2. Data Integrity**

Data integrity is crucial for reliable analysis and falls primarily within the data preparation phase of the data analytics lifecycle. It involves ensuring accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data throughout its lifecycle. When reviewing a data table, issues such as missing values, duplicate records, and inconsistent formats can be identified, all of which compromise data integrity. To resolve these issues, appropriate methods include implementing data validation rules, using software tools for detecting and correcting errors, and standardizing data entry processes. These steps help maintain the quality of data, enabling more accurate and effective analysis.

**3. Types of Data Analytics & Statistics**

The four main types of data analytics are descriptive, which summarizes past data to understand what has happened; diagnostic, which investigates that data to determine causes of outcomes; predictive, which uses models to forecast future scenarios; and prescriptive, which suggests actions to achieve desired outcomes. The selection of a data analytics type depends on the specific needs of a situation. For instance, predictive analytics, which includes techniques such as regression analysis, machine learning models, and time series forecasting, is ideal for scenarios where future trends or behaviors need to be anticipated to make informed decisions.

**4. Power BI Overview**

Power BI offers a range of capabilities to address specific data issues, including data visualization, integration, and advanced analytics. By navigating through Power BI Desktop, users can load various data sources and utilize its tools to create basic visuals such as charts and graphs. This process not only helps in presenting data more effectively but also in identifying and resolving underlying data issues through visual insights and analysis.

## Courses:

**1. Intro to Data Analytics:**

This course establishes a framework for data analytics as a series of progressive steps starting with the data source and ending
with the interpretation of results. We introduced fundamental concepts such as data integrity, the 4 types of data analytics
(descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive), and types of statistical analysis. Learners who complete this course will
be equipped with the skills to identify the type of data analytics strategy used in a given situation and where they stand in the
data analytics lifecycle. This course will also provide a basic overview of Power BI as the tool of choice for this Nanodegree
program.

**2. Data Preparation & Modeling**

The preparation phase is perhaps the most important step in data analysis. Before data can be effectively analyzed, an
effective data model is required, and creating that data model may utilize a wide range of skills. This course teaches the skills
needed to load, clean, and organize data in Power Query, and create relational tables in Power Query and Power BI. After
completing this course, learners will be able to effectively source data in Power BI and create a clean and efficient data model
for analysis.

**3. Predictive Data Analysis**

This course introduces learners to a selection of powerful tools in Power BI Desktop that can be used for predictive analysis.
Concepts such as classification, regression, and forecasting are discussed in detail, and various techniques are explored with
different data sets, allowing learners to practice predictive data analysis with a hands-on approach. The content covered in
this course can help an enterprise to understand future risk, analyze different markets, or make other decisions critical to an
organization.
